The 2017 CDRC Retail Catchment files for Comparison and Convenience areas. The geographies are used in CDRC Data - activated under the Centres and Catchments panel, they are the larger boundaries seen when selecting Convenience and/or Comparison, and clicking on a coloured dot on the map.

Boundaries and centroids for the retail centres themselves can be found at https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/retail-centre-definitions - the IDs used there and here match, and the retail centre files include names.

## Comparsion Catchments

This geodata pack provides the CDRC comparison retail catchments for the year 2017 for the retail centres of Great Britain. The data represent the maximum likely catchment area for the 2017 retail centres based on their size. They were created by calculating the isochrones (based on shortest road network distance) of the comparison retail centres. The data are provided in geopackage format that is supported by open source software such as QGIS and R.                                 

## Convenience Catchments

This geodata pack provides the CDRC convenience retail catchments for the year 2017 for the retail centres in Great Britain. The data represent the maximum likely catchment area for the 2017 retail centres based on their size. They were created by calculating the shortest road network distance between a convenience retail unit and the centroids of the Output Areas in Great Britain. The data are provided in geopackage format that is supported by open source software such as QGIS and R. [N.B. For this archive, the file has been converted to a zipped shapefile and very slightly simplified using Mapshaper, due to storage constraints.]
