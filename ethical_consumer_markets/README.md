The Ethical Consumer Markets Report has been produced annually by Ethical Consumer (ECRA) since 1999
and aims to provide a barometer on ethical spending in the UK. 

Included here are the reports for 2001-2014, and a data pack which provides the background
data used in the reports for the years 1999-2013. The files are published
in partnership between the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre and ECRA.

The reports and the data pack present information about the total and sectorial consumer spending on ethical purchasing.
