Missing data
In some data zones, the population in the considered age range is zero for some years. In these cases, a rate cannot be determined. This is denoted  by '*'.

Standardised ratios
A value of 100 is the Scotland average for a population with the same age and sex profile.

# Error in the working age population
# In a previous version of this file we included incorrect working age population figures. This only affects the variable "Working_age_population", now called "Working_age_population_Revised".
# SIMD16 ranks are not affected. For the calculation of the SIMD16 ranking, correct working age population figures were used.
