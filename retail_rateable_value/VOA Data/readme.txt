Estimated Change in the Rateable Value of Retail Premises

+ Abstract
These data provide the output of a model that explores the variable impact of the recession on current retail business rates. Regionally adjusted values are presented at the local authority scale for England; alongside retail centre adjusted values for a series of case study locations. These data were generated for a report produced in collaboration with the Local Data Company. Ancillary data used within the model were supplied by the Valuation Office Agency and Colliers International Ltd.
